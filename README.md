Opinion Dynamics and Polarization in Complex Networks

Research project developed at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV).

This work investigates how opinion polarization emerges in different network topologies under:

Simple vs Complex contagion

Scale-free and binomial networks

Emotional factor ("anger") influence

Different initial opinion distributions

Varying openness thresholds

🔬 Methods

Agent-based modeling

Network simulations

Statistical analysis

Python implementation

📊 Key Concepts

Complex networks

Information diffusion

Social polarization modeling

Computational social science
